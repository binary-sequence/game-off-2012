## Gameplay

The player controls a fire truck to extinguish fire.  
There is a control panel which have a gas pedal, a lever for the crane and a button to shoot water.  
You must pull the lever to change the crane position (that means the fireman position). Then push the commit button to shoot water. Water will extinguish the fire on the fireman position. Repeat for each floor that is burning.  
When all the floors of the building are safe, push the gas pedal to continue with the next flat.  
If a flat is destroyed, you will lose. How many buildings can you protect?
